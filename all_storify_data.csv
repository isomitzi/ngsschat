I hope the keywords in the framework don't head in that direction :) ""Buzzwordification"" is all too common. #NGSSchat"5/10/12 20:18,FredEnde,"I'm very excited for engaging in #argument.  We need to move away from the ""answer and move on"" process.   #ngsschat"5/10/12 20:18,ampercival,Q2: For me I'd say it's #1 and #6... because engineering hasn't been a nationwide focus for K-12 until now. #NGSSchat5/10/12 20:18,arosey,"Big shift: observations aren't the key, synthesizing from them becomes the focus and the key to the process. #ngsschat"5/10/12 20:19,FredEnde,"RT @arosey: Big shift: observations arent the key, synthesizing from them becomes the focus and the key to the process. #ngsschat"5/10/12 20:19,ampercival,"@fredende Yeah, that's a key one for moving away from pure inquiry. #NGSSchat"5/10/12 20:19,FredEnde,Howdy @arosey.  Thanks for joining! #ngsschat5/10/12 20:19,JenArnswald,I agree w/ @FredEnde too often we have kids complete tasks but they never process the meaning of what they are doing #ngsschat5/10/12 20:20,FredEnde,@arosey. . .Think it will be a big change for many to get away from facts for facts sake. #ngsschat5/10/12 20:21,FredEnde,"@JenArnswald Will also require folks to ""slow down"" when exploring ideas.  Solid argument requires lots of thought time. #ngsschat"5/10/12 20:22,FredEnde,I think #modeling is a big of a shift too.  I know we never really worked with models as much as we should have.  Others model? #ngsschat5/10/12 20:22,ampercival,RT @arosey: Integrating engineering practices into K-12.

Cross-Cutting Concepts are meant to help eds bridge divide between sci. and other disciplines. How do you see them being used? #ngsschat5/10/12 20:27,FredEnde,@ampercival Agreed.  Districts will really need to focus in on K-5/6 #sci #edu for #learning progressions to work. #ngsschat5/10/12 20:27,FredEnde,@arosey @ampercival It's tough.  #ELA and #math are a hyper-focus at #elem level. #ngsschat5/10/12 20:27,ampercival,@fredende Interesting... hadn't heard that. Do you mean bridge disciplines w/in science? #NGSSchat5/10/12 20:27,JenArnswald,Have to had a chance to look at the 8+1 model from MSU- totally reorganizes the way science is taught #ngsschat5/10/12 20:28,ampercival,@fredende Getting science a major role in K-5 may be the biggest barrier to the success of #NGSS in my opinion. #NGSSchat5/10/12 20:29,FredEnde,"@ampercival Within and from content area to content area.

Glad you're joining us!   #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:13,amykfmurphy,"A1: I am glad to see the connections to other topics, grades and the #CCSS. Some PE's easy to follow, others not so much. #NGSSchat"5/24/12 20:13,yanksmitch,"Q1: Personally I liked the layout, but I know that the amount of info threw off some. Could be simplified with just PEs and links  #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:14,FredEnde,Liked connections as well.  Thought that was a strong point.  Any PEs that stick out as particularly easy/challenging? #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:14,amykfmurphy,@yanksmitch I can see where some teachers could think PE's were to complex. #NGSSchat5/24/12 20:15,FredEnde,"@yanksmitch Agree.  Saw lots of feedback saying ""Too Much Info.""  PEs and links, remove foundation boxes? #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:15,yanksmitch,A1: As in specific PEs? or whole topics? #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:16,FredEnde,"@yanksmitch Let's start with a few specific PEs that stick out as being either very well done, or quite poor. #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:16,yanksmitch,"@amykfmurphy Did like how they were using the web with the hover details, so that the doc can be modified for reading diff ways #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:17,FredEnde,"@yanksmitch Liked that too.  Though I heard a lot of griping, I must say I also enjoyed color on/off option. #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:18,amykfmurphy,I focused on PS.SPM strand-was unclear on a) Construct models showing that stable forms of matter #NGSSchat (1/2)5/24/12 20:19,yanksmitch,"A1: Most PEs were easy to follow, espec with clarification statements. My issues are with how the PEs relate to each other #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:19,FredEnde,"Q2.  #NGSS was drafted with #elemsci PEs written by grade level rather than by band (i.e. K-2, 3-5).  Good idea?  Bad idea?  Why?  #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:19,amykfmurphy,#NGSSchat (2/2) are those with minimum magnetic and electrical field energy. Perhaps confused because I focus on stabilty of electrons...5/24/12 20:20,FredEnde,"@yanksmitch Yep.  There were some points where I said to myself, ""Wait, didn't we just do this?"" or ""Why is this here?"" #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:20,amykfmurphy,@yanksmitch That was a nice feature. #NGSSchat5/24/12 20:21,FredEnde,@amykfmurphy I'm following.  Could certainly see potential issues there. #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:21,amykfmurphy,"A2: PEs for #elemsci prob be better in bands, but I teach HS, so I'm not the expert there. #NGSSchat"5/24/12 20:21,yanksmitch,"A2: For MS and HS they are banded, and ""model pathways"" will be given. Why not do the same for ES? ... #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:22,yanksmitch,"A2: Specific grade level PEs make adoption much harder, and I don't think it's necessary to be so prescriptive. #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:22,FredEnde,@amykfmurphy One of my responsibilities is to direct a K-6 science curriculum.  Lack of banding is def. a problem. #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:23,FredEnde,@yanksmitch Agreed.  Can't figure it out.  Seems logical to provide choice and flexibility.  Why make #NGSS lockstep? #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:23,amykfmurphy,"@FredEnde and clarification statement for that #NGSS didn't clarify issue. Noted stable noble gases, ionic substances... #NGSSchat"5/24/12 20:24,yanksmitch,"On the flip side, specific grade level PEs will make commercial programs easier to create- maybe pandering to that? #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:24,FredEnde,@amykfmurphy Clarification statements were great. . . until they weren't :) #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:24,yanksmitch,"@FredEnde Also don't agree with where some topics were stuck.

We're talking #elemsci PEs and throwing in a bit of other items too!  Join as you see fit! #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:27,amykfmurphy,@FredEnde @yanksmitch I am curious why they switched from banding in NSES to grade specific in #NGSS. #NGSSchat5/24/12 20:27,dandanscienc,"Awesome! Thnx! Will do! 
 #Ngsschat"5/24/12 20:28,amykfmurphy,@dandanscienc Welcome!

Currently #NY standards use band approach from #NSES.  I'm stumped, really I am. #Confused #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:29,yanksmitch,"@amykfmurphy The grade specific PEs seem over-prescriptive, maybe it was felt this was needed since #elemsci is not as consistent? #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:29,FredEnde,@amykfmurphy Yes.  This is a major challenge.  I imagine @Achieve wanted to keep to the schedule and release in April.   #NGSSChat5/24/12 20:30,yanksmitch,@amykfmurphy Not happy about the timing either.

Not sure why timing has to be that short. . .  #NGSSChat"5/24/12 20:31,amykfmurphy,"@FredEnde in our AL Math Sci program, we provide materials based on current COS.. concerned that #NGSS don't match up ($$$) #NGSSchat"5/24/12 20:32,yanksmitch,@amykfmurphy Which is why it seems banding is so necessary.
